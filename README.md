# TrajectoryOptimizationSoftware
An algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization to find the best trajectory for a lap around a given track. The optimization takes into account steering and varying loss coefficients for different part of the track, allowing it to successfully avoid bumpers for example.

The project has been abandoned due to the dificulty to feed the algorithme quality data.
